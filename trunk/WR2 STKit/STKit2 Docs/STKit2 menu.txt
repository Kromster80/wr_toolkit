Special actions>
		-MBWR lightning fix
		Special for MBWR sceneries being converted to WR2. Adds ambient light to scenery preserving tunnel lights.
		-AFC11N lightning fix
		Special for AFC11N sceneries being converted to WR2. Fixes excessive blue highlights in lakes and rivers preserving scenery lightning. Aswell applies required blending masks to water materials, otherwise they don't work in WR2. This should be used aswell for custom addon sceneries with water surfaces.
		-Switch MBWR blending masks

		-Rebuild lightning
		Quick shortcut for scenery lightning update. Applies ambient color from LI tab and Sun light from SKY tab, aswell all scenery lights.
		-Rebuild shadows
