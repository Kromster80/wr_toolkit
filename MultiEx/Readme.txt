Multi-Extractor 0.8b
------------------------------------------------------

Description:
This program extracts files from following archives:
 - Synetic *.SYN (MBWR, MBTR, NICE2/BreackNeck).
 - Colin McRae Rally 4 (all).
 - Need For Speed *.VIV (tested only on NFS6).

How To Use:
Click "Open ..." Locate&Open any desired *.syn/*.viv file
OR: Double-click on *.syn/*.viv file and choose to open it with MultiEx.exe
(You`ll need to do it once, after that *.syn/*.viv files will be opened with Multi-Extarctor by default).
Change folder to extract files to (.\ by default)
OR: drag file to MultiExtractor window
Left-click on any file to see it`s info
Right-click on any desired file and select type of action to perform:
-Extract Selected - decompresses & extracts all selected files into defined folder
-Extract All - decompresses & extracts all files into defined folder

Notes:
MBWR can use decompressed files instead of SYN archives. Just extract all files into folder with SYN file and rename or delete SYN file.
If you are opening N.I.C.E.2 / BreackNeck archive, place a checkmark in "N.I.C.E.2 / BreackNeck archive" field.

Notes:
Program is written using Delphi 6.0, that`s why it is almost 600KB big. :-)
Your OS might be freezed while files are being extracted. I don`t know how to evade this. Just wait till the end of procedure please (about 10secs when extracting all files from 7MB archive on mine P4-2.26Ghz).

What`s Next:
On-the-fly converter of PTX files into BMP or similar format (May be TGA).
More formats support (Emperor, GTA3, C&C, SCGT).
File import.
